This project requires postgres to run. The credentials are not part of the repo as they include
passwords. To run on your own system, please add the following file:
host: localhost
database: Little_Guys
user: postgres
password: postgres
port: 5432

This project had its persistence done through pgAdmin 4, which is a newer tool to us.
If you have this software, please create a database called Little_Guys to run the system.

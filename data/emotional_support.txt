According to The Bubble.org, emotional support animals can help to reduce anxiety, panic attacks and symptoms of depression. 
They ease worry and provide a sense of connection which reduces loneliness and isolation. 
Especially with anxiety, these animals can help the person to ground themselves in a time of dissociation. 
The animals boost serotonin, dopamine and oxytocin â€“ the three main and most powerful feel-good chemicals released in the brain.
In addition, there are a multitude of different animals that can be classified as support animals.
However, obtaining a service animal can be difficult, costly, and overall inconvenient. Because of this, we 
at Lil Guy Finder have created a service for those looking for animals to keep them comfort. 
These animals can be either real, stuffed, or even non-animal based objects that offer you comfort. 
We have created a database full of Little Guys that, while not necessarily being
emotional support animals, could just help you get through your day.

DISCLAIMER: Lil Guy Finder is not responsible for your purchase of live animals, especially if they are not legal
in your state. If you match with a Lil Guy who is a dangerous creature, we STRONGLY recommend purchasing a stuffed
and/or plush version of said creature.
